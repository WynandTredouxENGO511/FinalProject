## Frontend

After cloning you need to install all the node modules (make sure you have node.js installed) by using the command

```console
npm install 
```

while in the /frontend directory. Once that is done installing to start the frontend development server use the command

```console
npm run serve
```

and the default address will be http://localhost:8080/. To close the server press CTRL + C or CTRL + D in the terminal.
