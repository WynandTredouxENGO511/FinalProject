You can access the data on this site using the following APIs:

http://localhost:5000/query?incident='Incident type'&date=y&community='Community Name'
http://localhost:5000/queryusers?community='Community Name'

Where 'Incident type' can be:
	"Theft From Vehicle", "Theft of Vehicle", "Break & Enter - Commercial",
   	"Assault (Non-domestic)", "Break & Enter - Dwelling", "Violence Other (Non-domestic)",
    "Break & Enter - Other Premises", "Street Robbery", "Commercial Robbery"
‘date’ is just a year
and ‘community’ is the name of the community you want to search for.

Niether query is case sensitive, and any of the parameters may be omitted (although you must submit at least one parameter)

The response is in the following format:
	{
		Data: [{"category": 
     			"community": 
      			"count": 
     			"date": }]
		"status": "success"
	}

You can also query for multiple parameter values separated by a comma, for example:
http://localhost:5000/query?incident='Theft FROM vehicle','theft OF Vehicle'&date=2018,2019&community= 'Calgary International Airport','12A'\
